# How to find my PIM product associations in SFCC?

1. Select your SFCC site, then click on `Merchant Tools`
2. Then click on `Products` menu
3. Use the search engine to find the product you want to know about its product associations.
4. Click on the `Recommendations` tab of this product.

:::info
Depending on the [configuration of your cartridge](mapping-configuration.html#product-association-mapping), the `Recommendation Type` column will indicate the PIM `association type` used.

# What about "product links" in SFCC?

Salesforce recommends using `Recommendations` instead of `Product links` in SFCC for product association.

:::warning
`Product links` are therefore not used by the current version of the cartridge. However, aware that some customers still use the notion of `product links` in SFCC for their product association, we are considering adding this other mapping possibility in a future cartridge version.
