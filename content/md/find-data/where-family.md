# How to find my PIM families in SFCC?


**Since the notion of "attribute family" (attribute set) does not exist in SFCC, the cartridge can't import PIM families.**

All attributes from PIM families are therefore imported into SFCC.

Each SFCC product contains all PIM attributes and only attributes related to the product are filled in.
